# CS-361-Project
CS 361 Assignment #1

Hey there, this is my CS 361 project. The main file is UI.py which calls upon password-srv.py and encryption_microservice.py (which my partner made) using HTTP requests. 

**There are multiple features including:**
  - compromised-password-check
  - common-password-check
  - combined-check  
    (Checks if compromised or common)
  - complexity-check  
    (Checks if password meets complexity requirements)  
  - password-recommendation  
    (Recommends a safe and strong password of any length)  
  - help   
    (Pulls up explanation videos; Will force you to exit when done)  

Enjoy!
